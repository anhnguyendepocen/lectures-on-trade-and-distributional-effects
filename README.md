# Lectures on trade and distributional effects

Contains notes and code from the lectures on trade and distributional effects that I am giving at CEMFI.

- [Notes.](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/lectures-on-trade-and-distributional-effects/blob/master/notes/cemfi_notes.pdf) which outlies my thinking on these subjects. Right now: Diff-in-Diff approaches and how one obviously important departure from the canonical Ricardian model of trade (add the immobility of labor) allows us to work through the core implications/problems of diff-in-diff research design.  


- [Syllabus.](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/lectures-on-trade-and-distributional-effects/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus_waugh_cemfi_trade.pdf) basic information regarding the stuff I want to cover.
