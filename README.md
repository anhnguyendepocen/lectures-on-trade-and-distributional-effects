# Lectures on trade and distributional effects

Contains notes and code from the lectures on trade and distributional effects that I am giving at CEMFI.

- [Notes.](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/lectures-on-trade-and-distributional-effects/blob/master/notes/cemfi_notes.pdf) which outlies my thinking on these subjects. Right now: Diff-in-Diff approaches and how one important departure from the canonical Ricardian model of trade (add the immobility of labor) allows us to understand and work through the core implications/problems of diff-in-diff research design.  

- [Syllabus.](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/lectures-on-trade-and-distributional-effects/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus_waugh_cemfi_trade.pdf) Basic information regarding the stuff I want to talk about.

- [Code and Data.](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/lectures-on-trade-and-distributional-effects/tree/master/code) Right now contains jupyter notebook to replicate aspects of ADH. Will modify to highlight interesting things about their results.
