A bunch of labor markets on which
\begin{itemize}
\item Households who live within that labor market,
\smallskip
\item Competitive producers on an island produce a differentiated good,
\smallskip
\item Producers are subject local and world productivity shocks.
\end{itemize}

Households have some options\ldots

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]{Everything A-OK? \ Not quite.}
In our model, the competitive equilibrium does not correspond with the socially optimal outcome.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Households would like insurance against privately uninsurable shocks.
\smallskip
\item Some of these shocks are trade related, so tariffs might help!
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item \small \citet{Corden_74}, \citet{baldwin1982political}, \citet{newbery1984pareto}, \citet{Eaton85}, \citet{dixit1987trade, Dixit_89, dixit1989trade}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Our idea: Rather than use tariffs, use the tax system.
\begin{itemize}
\item That is, the government could use a progressive tax system to provide social insurance.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]{Use Progressive Taxation to Insure the Losers from Trade?}
One motive for progressive taxation: provide social insurance for privately uninsurable shocks (possibly trade related).
\begin{itemize}
\item \citet{varian1980redistributive} and \citet{eaton1980optimal}.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
But theses polices come with costs\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\item Reductions in labor supply; reductions in migration\ldots
\smallskip
\item $\Rightarrow$ Losses in economic efficiency.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Our question:\\
\smallskip
\textbf{How does openness to trade change this cost-benefit calculation?}

\begin{frame}[t]{Final Thoughts}
Hard to deny that the benefits of globalization have been under attack\ldots\\
And motivating this attack is the idea that trade has imposed hardship on some segments of the population.\\
\bigskip
The goals of our work are too\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand and evaluate these hardships in an interpretable way
\smallskip
\item Provide sensible policy responses.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\smallskip
Bonus idea: Concerns about automation are directly related to our work.
\begin{itemize}
\item Like trade, automation is a labor saving technology that helps many, but harms those exposed to it.
\smallskip
\item Increasing progressivity as automation increases may improve welfare.
\end{itemize}
